Abstract
--------
- federated learning is threatened by adversarial attacks against the integrity of the learning model and the privacy of data via a distributed approach to tackle local and global learning
-  A taxonomy of 
   
   #. adversarial attacks (e.g., ....)

   #. defence methods (e.g., ....)

that depict a general picture of this vulnerability of federated learning and how to overcome it

Introduction
------------
- Adversarial attacks

  -  malicious manipulation of the training data :cite:`dalvi2004adversarial`

Differnt types of Federated Learning
-------------------------------------
#. Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL) 共同的 Feature space

    - Each data source has the differnt feature space and sample space
    - HFL will only use the overlapped feature space to train the model
    
#. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) 共同的 Sample space
#. Federated Transfer Learning (FTL)

Term Explanation
----------------
- **Federated Learning** aims at generating a collaboratively trained global learning model without sharing the data owned by the distributed data sources
